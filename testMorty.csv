6,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty."
7,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage."
8,1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?"
9,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."

11,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start."
12,1,1,Pilot,Morty,T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
13,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."

19,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"And so that's the surprise, Morty."
20,1,1,Pilot,Morty,"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!"
21,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty."
22,1,1,Pilot,Morty,"What are you talking about, Rick?"
23,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty."
24,1,1,Pilot,Morty,I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—
25,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways."
27,1,1,Pilot,Morty,"That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel."
28,1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Get off of me, Morty!"
29,1,1,Pilot,Morty,"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!"
